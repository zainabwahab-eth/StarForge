## Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Install Rust** (if not already installed)
3. **Build the project**: `cargo build`
4. **Run tests**: `cargo test`
5. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name`
6. **Make changes** and commit with clear messages
7. **Push and open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch

---

## Prerequisites

### Rust

StarForge requires **Rust 1.80 or later**. 

#### Install Rust

If you don't have Rust installed, use [rustup](https://rustup.rs) — the official Rust toolchain installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

After installation, verify your version:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

#### Update Rust (if already installed)

```bash
rustup update stable
```

### Additional Tools

- **Git** for version control
- **A text editor or IDE** (VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, etc.)

---

## Development Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nanle-code/StarForge.git
cd StarForge
```

### Verify Your Setup

Run the info command to check your environment:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run -- info
```

You should see output with your Rust version and system information.

---

## Building the Project

### Build for Development (Debug)

```bash
cargo build
```

This produces an unoptimized binary in `target/debug/starforge`. Builds are fast, useful during development.

### Build for Release (Optimized)

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This produces an optimized binary in `target/release/starforge`. Builds are slower but the binary is much faster.

### Install Locally

After building, you can install the binary to your PATH:

```bash
# From debug build
cp target/debug/starforge ~/.local/bin/

# Or from release build
cp target/release/starforge ~/.local/bin/

# Then verify installation
starforge --version
```

---

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

This runs all unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests.

### Run Tests with Output

If you want to see `println!` output from passing tests:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Run a single test
cargo test test_wallet_create

# Run tests matching a pattern
cargo test wallet

# Run integration tests from a specific file
cargo test --test wallet_lifecycle_e2e
```

### Run Tests in Parallel

Tests run in parallel by default. To run sequentially (useful for debugging):

```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

### Run Smoke Tests

The project includes quick smoke tests to verify basic functionality:

```bash
cargo test --test cli_smoke
```

### Run Optional-Feature Tests (hardware wallets)

Ledger and Trezor support lives behind the `hardware-wallet` Cargo feature
and is skipped by the default `cargo test` above. CI compiles and tests it
in a dedicated `hardware-wallet` job on every push, so run the same command
locally before touching `src/utils/hardware_wallet.rs`:

```bash
# Linux: apt-get install -y libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev first
cargo build --locked --features hardware-wallet
cargo test --locked --features hardware-wallet
```

No physical device is required — the tests assert the approval, rejection,
unsupported-envelope, and disconnected/no-device paths, either against pure
APDU-parsing logic or against the real `hidapi`/`trezor-client` backends'
"no device found" behavior. See
[BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md#4-feature-flag-issues)
for per-OS system dependencies.

### Check Code Quality

The CI pipeline runs several quality checks. Run them locally:

```bash
# Format check
cargo fmt --all --check

# Linter check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Secure defaults audit
cargo test --test secure_defaults_audit
# Doctests (compiles examples in doc comments)
cargo test --doc

# Dependency security check (requires cargo-deny)
cargo install cargo-deny
cargo deny check
```

### Supply-Chain Policy with cargo-deny

StarForge enforces supply-chain security via [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny). The configuration lives in `deny.toml` at the repository root and is enforced in CI on every push and pull request.

**What cargo-deny checks:**

| Check | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| **Advisories** | Known security vulnerabilities in dependencies (via the RustSec advisory database) |
| **Licenses** | Only approved open-source licenses are permitted in the dependency tree |
| **Bans** | Detects duplicate crate versions and blocks specific crates if needed |
| **Sources** | Only dependencies from crates.io are allowed; no untrusted registries or git sources |

**Running cargo-deny locally:**

```bash
# Install (if not present)
cargo install cargo-deny

# Run all checks
cargo deny check

# Run a specific check
cargo deny check advisories
cargo deny check licenses
cargo deny check bans
cargo deny check sources

# Run with all features enabled (matches CI)
cargo deny check --all-features
```

**When a dependency fails the license policy:**

1. Run `cargo deny check licenses` to identify the crate and its license.
2. If the license is compatible with MIT (the project's license), add it to the `allow` list in `deny.toml` under `[licenses].allow` with a comment explaining why.
3. If the license is incompatible or unclear, investigate an alternative crate or seek a maintainer decision before merging.

**When an advisory is detected:**

1. Check the advisory ID (e.g., `RUSTSEC-2024-0388`) at [rustsec.org](https://rustsec.org).
2. If the vulnerability affects the project, update the dependency to a patched version.
3. If the vulnerability is in a dev-only dependency or is otherwise mitigated, add the ID to `[advisories].ignore` in `deny.toml` with a rationale comment.
4. Never silently ignore advisories — every ignore entry must have a documented justification.

**Source/registry violations:**

- The policy denies all registries except crates.io and all git sources.
- If a new dependency requires a non-crates.io source, it must be explicitly approved and added to `deny.toml` with a rationale.
- Path dependencies for workspace members are handled separately by the `[graph]` targets configuration.

**Intentional exceptions:**

The project permits narrow, documented exceptions in `deny.toml`:
- Advisory ignores include the rationale for each skipped RUSTSEC ID.
- The `ring` crate has a manual license clarification because it lacks a standard license field.
- Duplicate crate versions are allowed as warnings (not errors) to maintain compatibility while flagging potential improvements.

**Running the configuration tests:**

```bash
# Validate the deny.toml configuration
cargo test --test cargo_deny_config
```

## Documentation Snippets

The shell examples in `README.md` and `docs/` are checked in CI by the **Docs
Snippets** job ([`scripts/docs-snippets.py`](scripts/docs-snippets.py)). Every
shell code block (`bash`, `sh`, `shell`, `console`, `powershell`, ...) must say
whether it runs, with a word after the language on the opening fence:

| Fence | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `` ```bash run `` | Executed in CI and must exit 0. |
| `` ```bash run fails `` | Executed and must exit **non-zero**. Use it to document an error. |
| `` ```bash run local `` | Executed only when a local network is available (`--local-network`). |
| `` ```bash norun `` | Never executed. Use it for snippets that need secrets, funded accounts, mainnet, Docker, hardware wallets, Ollama, or placeholder values like `<CONTRACT_ID>`. |

GitHub still highlights `` ```bash run `` as Bash. An unannotated shell block
fails the job, and so does an untagged block containing a `starforge` command.

How `run` blocks execute:

- Each Markdown file gets a fresh temporary `HOME` and working directory. Its
  `run` blocks execute **in order** in that sandbox, so a later block can use
  a wallet or project that an earlier block created.
- Each block runs as `bash -euo pipefail` with the just-built `starforge`
  first on `PATH` and `STARFORGE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`, so a command waiting on a
  prompt fails instead of hanging.
- In `console` blocks, only lines that start with `$ ` run. Other lines are
  treated as sample output.
- Failures are reported as `path:line` and shown as annotations on the PR.

Prefer `run` whenever a snippet can work offline. If a command needs the
network, put a runnable offline variant next to it (for example `--help` or
`--dry-run`) instead of marking everything `norun`.

```bash norun
cargo build
python3 scripts/docs-snippets.py                     # lint + run README.md and docs/
python3 scripts/docs-snippets.py docs/USAGE.md       # a single file
python3 scripts/docs-snippets.py --lint-only         # annotations only, no build needed
python3 scripts/docs-snippets.py --try-unannotated docs/NEW.md   # triage new docs
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Use a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/issue-XXX-description
```

Naming conventions:
- `feat/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation improvements
- `refactor/` for code refactoring
- `test/` for test additions or improvements

### 2. Make Changes

Edit files in your preferred editor. The project structure:

```
src/
├── main.rs                # CLI entry point
├── commands/              # Command implementations
│   ├── wallet.rs
│   ├── new.rs
│   ├── deploy.rs
│   ├── contract.rs
│   └── ...
└── utils/                 # Helper utilities
    ├── config.rs
    ├── horizon.rs
    ├── soroban.rs
    └── print.rs
```

### 3. Write/Update Tests

When adding features, include tests:

```bash
# Add unit tests in the same file
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_my_feature() {
        // Your test here
    }
}
```

For integration tests, create a new file in `tests/`:

```bash
# tests/my_feature.rs
#[test]
fn test_my_feature() {
    // Your test here
}
```

### 4. Run Tests Locally

```bash
cargo test
```

### 5. Check Code Quality

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

### 6. Commit Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add wallet encryption support"
```

Commit message format:
- Start with type: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Use lowercase
- Be specific and concise
- Example: `fix: resolve panic in contract deployment with large files`

### 7. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feat/issue-XXX-description
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub. Use the provided template and follow the checklist.

### 8. Architectural Changes & ADRs

If your PR introduces or alters major architectural patterns (such as client binding formats, plugin ABIs, telemetry defaults, simulation engines, or storage schemas), you must include an **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**.
- See the [ADR Index and Process](docs/adr/README.md).
- Copy [`docs/adr/template.md`](docs/adr/template.md) and record the context, considered options, and decision outcomes.

---

## Code Quality, Security, and Incident Response

StarForge enforces consistent code quality through automated CI checks. See [CI_ENFORCEMENT.md](CI_ENFORCEMENT.md) for full details.

### Security Logging and Incident Response Requirements

All security-relevant operations must be properly logged for auditability and debugging:
- See [SECURITY_LOGGING_GUIDE.md](SECURITY_LOGGING_GUIDE.md) for logging standards.
- In the event of suspected secret key or credential leakage, immediately follow the [Incident Response Runbook](docs/SECURITY_INCIDENT_RUNBOOK.md).

Key principles:

- **Log all security operations** - Wallet creation, encryption, deployment, plugin loading, etc.
- **Never log secrets** - Private keys, passphrases, encryption keys must be redacted
- **Include context** - Operation type, outcome, timestamp, and relevant details
- **Use structured logging** - JSON format for machine parsing and aggregation
- **Verify in tests** - Security logging behavior should be tested

Before submitting a PR with security-relevant changes:
1. Check [SECURITY_LOGGING_GUIDE.md](SECURITY_LOGGING_GUIDE.md) for what should be logged
2. Review [SECURITY_LOGGING_BEST_PRACTICES.md](SECURITY_LOGGING_BEST_PRACTICES.md) for implementation patterns
3. Ensure logs don't contain secrets or sensitive data
4. Test that logs provide useful audit trail information

### Formatting

Use Rust's built-in formatter:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```

This is automatically checked in CI. All code must pass `cargo fmt --all --check`.

**Pre-commit tip**: Format before every commit:
```bash
cargo fmt --all && git add .
```

### Linting

Use Clippy to catch common mistakes:

```bash
cargo clippy --locked -- -D warnings
```

Fix any warnings before submitting a PR. All code must pass this check in CI.

**Pre-commit tip**: Run locally before pushing:
```bash
cargo clippy --locked -- -D warnings
```

### Code Style Standards

For detailed code style expectations, see [CODE_STYLE_STANDARDS.md](CODE_STYLE_STANDARDS.md). This covers:

- Naming conventions (functions, variables, constants, types)
- Documentation requirements
- Error handling patterns
- Testing expectations
- Common Clippy violations and how to fix them

### Documentation

- Add doc comments to all public functions and types:

```rust
/// Brief description of what this function does.
///
/// More detailed explanation if needed.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `arg1` - description
///
/// # Returns
/// Description of return value
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = my_function(42);
/// assert_eq!(result, 43);
/// ```
pub fn my_function(arg1: i32) -> i32 {
    arg1 + 1
}
```

- **Add compilable doctests** to public utility functions (see [DOCTEST_GUIDELINES.md](DOCTEST_GUIDELINES.md))
- Keep README and other docs up-to-date with your changes
- Update CHANGELOG if your change is user-facing

### Pre-Commit Validation

Run this before every commit to catch issues early:

```bash
cargo fmt --all && \
  cargo build --locked && \
  cargo test --locked && \
  cargo test --doc --locked && \
  cargo clippy --locked -- -D warnings
```

All of these are checked in CI. See [DOCTEST_GUIDELINES.md](DOCTEST_GUIDELINES.md) for how to write and maintain doctests.

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Branch Protection & Merge Requirements

StarForge enforces strict branch protections on the `master` branch to guarantee codebase stability, correctness, and security.

> **A pull request is merged only when every required CI check is green on its latest commit _and_ the branch has no merge conflicts with `master`.** The authoritative list of required checks, and how maintainers configure them, is in [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md).

#### 1. Required CI Status Checks
Every Pull Request must achieve passing status on all required CI checks before it can be merged. The required status checks are:

| CI Job | Purpose | Command / Verification |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| **Rustfmt** | Code formatting standards | `cargo fmt --all --check` |
| **MSRV (Rust 1.80)** | Rust 1.80 MSRV compilation | `cargo check --locked --workspace` |
| **Cargo Deny** | Dependency security & license audit | `cargo deny check --all-features` |
| **Secure Defaults Audit** | Security-sensitive defaults stay safe | `cargo test --test secure_defaults_audit --locked` |
| **Documentation Tests** | Doc examples compile and pass | `cargo test --doc --locked` |
| **Feature Matrix** | Full build, JSON contract stability & test suite across feature combinations (default, no-default, ai, hardware) | `cargo build`, `cargo test` with various `--features` |
| **Docs Cheat Sheet (anti-drift)** | Generated command cheat sheet is current | `cargo build --locked` then `git diff --exit-code -- docs/COMMAND_CHEATSHEET.md` |
| **Clippy Lint** | Zero lint warnings allowed | `cargo clippy --all-features --locked -- -D warnings` |
| **CLI Smoke Tests (Linux)** | End-to-end CLI integration | `cli_cross_platform`, `cli_smoke`, `scripts/e2e-smoke.sh` |
| **macOS CLI Tests** / **Windows CLI Tests** | Cross-platform CLI validation | `cli_cross_platform`, `cli_smoke` |

#### 2. Conflict-Free Requirement
- All PRs must have **zero merge conflicts** against `master`; GitHub blocks the merge button while conflicts exist.
- PR branches must be rebased on the latest `master` before merge.
- If conflicts arise during review, rebase locally and force-push to your PR branch:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/master
  # Resolve any conflicts
  git push --force-with-lease origin feat/your-branch
  ```

#### 3. Code Review & Approvals
- PRs require at least one approving review from a project maintainer.
- All review conversations must be resolved before merging.

---

### Local Preflight Verification (`scripts/preflight-pr.sh`)

To avoid CI failures and ensure your PR passes all merge gates on the first try, run the local preflight script:

```bash
# Run standard merge gate checks
./scripts/preflight-pr.sh

# Run quick checks (fmt, clippy, unit tests, JSON contract)
./scripts/preflight-pr.sh --quick

# Auto-format and verify
./scripts/preflight-pr.sh --fix

# Run full test suite
./scripts/preflight-pr.sh --all
```

The script automatically executes:
1. **Git hygiene & conflict check**: Fails on unresolved conflict markers, an in-progress merge/rebase, or a trial merge into `origin/master` that would conflict
2. **Rustfmt**: Verifies all code matches formatting standards
3. **Workspace check**: Verifies compilation across the entire workspace
4. **Clippy**: Verifies zero warnings with `--all-features -- -D warnings`, exactly as CI runs it
5. **Contract stability**: Verifies JSON contract schema invariants
6. **Secure defaults audit**: Runs `secure_defaults_audit`
7. **Tests**: Executes unit and smoke tests (`--all` adds the full suite, doctests, and cross-platform CLI tests)
8. **Drift checks**: Fails if the build changes `docs/COMMAND_CHEATSHEET.md` or `Cargo.lock`
9. **Cargo Deny**: Audits dependencies for vulnerabilities and license issues (if `cargo-deny` is installed)

The script exits with a **non-zero status code** if any check fails, reporting exactly which gate needs attention.

---

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Fork and clone the repository
- [ ] Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/your-feature`)
- [ ] Make your changes and add/update tests
- [ ] Run `./scripts/preflight-pr.sh` and ensure all gates pass (exit code `0`)
- [ ] Verify branch is rebased on latest `master` with no conflicts
- [ ] Update relevant documentation if applicable
- [ ] Commit with clear messages and push to your fork

### Pull Request Checklist

When opening a PR, fill out the template with:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of what changed and why
- **Type**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test
- **Related Issues**: Link to issue(s) being resolved (e.g., `closes #208`)
- **Tests**: Describe any tests added/modified
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Code follows style guidelines (`cargo fmt`)
  - [ ] Self-reviewed own code
  - [ ] Added tests for new functionality
  - [ ] Passed local preflight checks (`./scripts/preflight-pr.sh`)
  - [ ] All CI status checks passing
  - [ ] No merge conflicts with `master`
  - [ ] Updated documentation if needed
  - [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented)

### PR Guidelines

- **Pass All CI Gates**: PRs cannot merge unless every required status check in [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md) is green on the latest commit.
- **Ensure No Conflicts**: Keep your branch up to date with `master`.
- **Run Preflight Locally**: Always execute [`./scripts/preflight-pr.sh`](scripts/preflight-pr.sh) before opening or updating a PR; it exits non-zero when any merge gate fails.
- **Keep PRs focused**: One issue per PR when possible
- **Keep PRs scoped**: Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and merge faster
- **Write clear descriptions**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- **Reference issues**: Use `closes #XXX` to automatically link issues
- **Test thoroughly**: Include test cases for both happy path and edge cases
- **Update docs**: If your changes affect user-facing behavior, update docs

## Writing Plugins

Building a StarForge plugin, or changing one of the example plugins? Start with
the [plugin authoring cookbook](docs/plugins/cookbook.md). It walks through a
hello-world plugin, capabilities, testing, signing, trust metadata, publishing
and ABI compatibility, using the example plugins in
[`examples/plugins/`](examples/plugins/). CI builds and tests those examples in
the **Plugin Cookbook Examples** job; run the same check locally with:

```bash
cp Cargo.lock examples/plugins/Cargo.lock
cargo test --manifest-path examples/plugins/Cargo.toml --workspace
```

---

## Contributing to AI Features

StarForge integrates AI features for smart contract generation and automated documentation. When contributing to these features:

### Guidelines
1. **Mock External Calls in Tests**: Ensure all unit and integration tests do not query live OpenAI or Anthropic endpoints. Use mocked endpoints or verify inputs/outputs via local unit tests.
2. **Prompts Verification**: If you modify the prompt configurations in `src/utils/ollama.rs` or `src/commands/generate.rs`, verify that the system context still enforces strictly compilable Soroban Rust code and adheres to `#![no_std]`.
3. **Structured Response Formats**: When building tools that parse LLM output programmatically, enforce JSON output structures using formatting schemas or system templates rather than trusting loose markdown responses.
4. **Local-First Precedence**: Keep local Ollama support up-to-date. Ensure fallback warnings correctly instruct developers on how to pull and serve local models.

For more information, see [ARCHITECTURE_AI.md](ARCHITECTURE_AI.md), [AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md), and [AI_PROMPT_GUIDE.md](AI_PROMPT_GUIDE.md).

---

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting, see [BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### "rustc version mismatch"

Ensure you're on the correct Rust version:

```bash
rustup update stable
rustc --version  # Should be 1.80 or later
```

### "cargo: command not found"

Rust and Cargo weren't installed correctly. Reinstall using rustup:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

### Build fails with "dependency not found"

Clear the build cache and rebuild:

```bash
cargo clean
cargo build
```

### Tests fail with "permission denied"

On macOS/Linux, make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/e2e-smoke.sh
```

### "Cannot connect to Horizon API"

Some tests require network access. If tests fail due to network issues:

```bash
# Run only local tests (no network)
cargo test --lib

# Run tests with retries
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

### Wallet tests fail with "STARFORGE_TEST_SECRET_KEY not set"

Some tests require a test secret key. Set it:

```bash
export STARFORGE_TEST_SECRET_KEY="SXXX..."  # Your test key
cargo test
```

### Clippy warnings won't go away

Update Clippy:

```bash
rustup update stable
cargo clean
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

### Build Baseline Status

For a complete verification of the project's build status, see [BUILD_BASELINE_VERIFICATION.md](BUILD_BASELINE_VERIFICATION.md).

This document confirms:
- ✅ All 22 command handlers are properly implemented
- ✅ All 24 utility modules are properly declared
- ✅ Zero unresolved imports across 74 source files
- ✅ All test files are ready to execute
- ✅ The baseline is clean and ready for development
