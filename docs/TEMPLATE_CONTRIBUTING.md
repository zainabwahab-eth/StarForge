# Template Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing a smart contract template to the StarForge library!
This document covers every step from writing your template to getting it accepted.

---

## Quick-start checklist

Before opening a pull request, confirm each item:

- [ ] Template compiles with `cargo build` targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- [ ] Template passes its own test suite (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Template source uses `{{PROJECT_NAME_PASCAL}}` as the contract struct name
- [ ] A `README.md` is included describing the contract and its public functions
- [ ] `registry.json` entry is present with all required fields
- [ ] `starforge template validate templates/registry.json` reports no problems
- [ ] `security_review` field is present (status `"pending"` is acceptable for new submissions)
- [ ] `changelog` field has at least one entry for the initial version
- [ ] A non-empty `LICENSE` file is included at the template root
- [ ] `template.json` declares an exact SPDX `license` identifier matching the CLI `--license` value
- [ ] `template.json` includes a non-empty `authors` field or `attribution` field
- [ ] `TEMPLATE_CONTRIBUTING.md` checklist items have all been addressed

## Template authoring kit

Create a starter template with `starforge template new my-template --output ./templates/examples`. It generates `template.json`, `README.md`, `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, and `tests/fixture.json`.

Lint the template with `starforge template lint ./templates/examples/my-template`. This checks the registry schema, SPDX license and license file, attribution metadata, and security scanner. Publishing applies the same legal metadata checks before writing to the marketplace.

Test the template with `starforge template test my-template`. The command reads `tests/fixture.json`, renders the template using the sample inputs, and runs `cargo test` on the rendered project.

The generated fixture uses `project_name`; template files can use `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{PROJECT_NAME_SNAKE}}`, and `{{PROJECT_NAME_PASCAL}}` for substitutions.

Recommended workflow: `template new` → edit → `template lint` → `template test` → `template validate` → PR.

## Template structure

Every template lives under `templates/examples/<template-name>/` and follows this layout:

```
templates/examples/<template-name>/
├── Cargo.toml          # crate manifest — uses {{PROJECT_NAME}}
├── README.md           # user-facing documentation
└── src/
    └── lib.rs          # contract source
```

### Cargo.toml requirements

```toml
[package]
name = "{{PROJECT_NAME}}"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "22.0.0", features = ["alloc"] }

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "22.0.0", features = ["testutils"] }
```

Use `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` as the crate name — StarForge replaces this with the
user's project name when scaffolding.

### Contract source requirements

- Must start with `#![no_std]`
- Must use `{{PROJECT_NAME_PASCAL}}` as the contract struct name (double-brace placeholder)
- Must include a module-level doc comment (`//! …`) explaining the contract
- Must include a `#[cfg(test)] mod test { … }` block with at least two meaningful tests
- Must compile without warnings

```rust
#![no_std]
//! Brief description of the contract.
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Env};

#[contract]
pub struct {{PROJECT_NAME_PASCAL}};

#[contractimpl]
impl {{PROJECT_NAME_PASCAL}} {
    // ...
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_happy_path() { /* ... */ }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "…")]
    fn test_error_case() { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

## Registry entry

Every template must have a corresponding entry in `templates/registry.json`.
Below is the minimum required shape:

```json
{
  "name": "my-template",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "One-line description of what the contract does",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "authors": ["Your Name"],
  "attribution": "Copyright (c) 2026 Your Name",
  "tags": ["defi", "my-category"],
  "source": { "type": "builtin", "id": "my-template" },
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "verified": false,
  "documented": true,
  "maintenance": "active",
  "license": "MIT",
  "security_review": {
    "status": "pending",
    "audited_at": null,
    "auditor": null,
    "findings": null,
    "score": null
  },
  "changelog": [
    { "version": "1.0.0", "date": "2025-01-01", "notes": "Initial release" }
  ]
}
```

Include the matching license text in a non-empty `LICENSE` file at the
template root. `license` must be an exact SPDX license identifier, not a
license expression. For attribution, provide either a non-empty `authors`
string/list or a non-empty `attribution` string. If you pass `--license` when
publishing, it must exactly match the manifest value.

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | ✓ | Unique kebab-case identifier |
| `version` | ✓ | Semver string (`major.minor.patch`) |
| `description` | ✓ | One-line summary (≤ 120 chars) |
| `author` | ✓ | Author name or GitHub handle |
| `tags` | ✓ | At least one tag from the [tag taxonomy](#tag-taxonomy) |
| `source` | ✓ | `builtin`, `git`, or `local` source descriptor |
| `license` | required for publish | Exact SPDX license identifier (`MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, …) |
| `authors` or `attribution` | required for publish | Non-empty author list/string or attribution statement |
| `security_review` | recommended | Audit status — `pending` is fine initially |
| `changelog` | recommended | At least one entry |
| `maintenance` | recommended | `active`, `maintained`, `deprecated`, or `unknown` |

`security_review.findings` is a number (the count of findings) or `null` — not
a quoted string.

### Validating your entry

`templates/registry.schema.json` is the authoritative shape of a registry
entry, and StarForge validates against it before loading any registry. Check
your entry before opening a pull request:

```bash norun
# the whole registry, including your new entry
starforge template validate templates/registry.json

# or just your entry, saved to its own file
starforge template validate ./my-template.json
```

Problems are reported field by field, so you can fix them directly:

```text
templates[12].version: 'v1.0' is not valid semver (expected major.minor.patch, e.g. "1.2.0")
templates[12].changelog[0].date: '01/06/2025' is not a date in YYYY-MM-DD form
templates[12].source.id: required field is missing
```

Field names the schema does not know are reported as warnings rather than
errors, so a typo like `descripton` shows up without breaking older CLIs that
read a newer registry. See
[`templates/README.md`](templates/README.md#registry-validation) for the full
list of checks.

### Tag taxonomy

Use at least one of these standard tags so search works reliably:

| Tag | Used for |
|---|---|
| `token` | Fungible token contracts |
| `nft` | Non-fungible token contracts |
| `defi` | DeFi primitives (AMM, lending, staking, …) |
| `dao` | Governance / DAO contracts |
| `governance` | Voting and proposal contracts |
| `multisig` | Multi-signature wallets and vaults |
| `security` | Auth, access-control, and audit-focused contracts |
| `payments` | Payment channels, escrow, and invoicing |
| `staking` | Yield / staking contracts |
| `standard` | SEP-conformant contracts |

## Security review process

The StarForge Security Team reviews every new template before setting
`verified: true`. Until review is complete, the template is published with
`"status": "pending"`.

### What gets reviewed

1. **Authorization checks** — every mutating function calls `require_auth()` on
   the right principal; no function can be called by an arbitrary address.
2. **Re-entrancy** — state is updated before external token transfers.
3. **Integer arithmetic** — no unchecked arithmetic that could overflow or wrap.
4. **Initialization guards** — contracts cannot be re-initialized.
5. **Storage hygiene** — correct use of `instance`, `persistent`, and `temporary`
   storage lifetimes.
6. **Panic messages** — descriptive error strings, no empty panics.

### Review SLA

| Priority | Target turnaround |
|---|---|
| Security fix | 48 hours |
| New template | 7 days |
| Version bump | 5 days |

### Requesting an expedited review

Open a GitHub issue with the label `security-review-request` and link your PR.
The Security Team triages these daily.

## Version bumping

When updating an existing template:

1. Increment the `version` field in the `registry.json` entry following semver:
   - **Patch** (`x.y.Z`) — bug fixes, doc improvements, no API changes.
   - **Minor** (`x.Y.0`) — new optional functions, backward-compatible changes.
   - **Major** (`X.0.0`) — breaking changes to the public API.
2. Add a new entry at the **top** of the `changelog` array.
3. Update `updated_at` to the current date.
4. Reset `security_review.status` to `"pending"` if the change affects contract logic.

---

## Testing your template

Run the template's own tests from the StarForge CLI before submitting:

```bash norun
# Run tests via cargo directly
cargo test --manifest-path templates/examples/my-template/Cargo.toml

# Or via the CLI (once registered)
starforge template test my-template
```

All tests must pass with zero warnings.

---

## Generating documentation

After adding your registry entry you can preview the generated Markdown docs:

```bash norun
starforge template docs my-template
# write to a file
starforge template docs my-template --output docs/templates/my-template.md
```

---

## Pull request process

1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/template-my-template`
2. Add your template files and registry entry.
3. Run `cargo test` from the repo root to verify nothing is broken.
4. Open a PR against `main` with the title `feat(templates): add my-template`.
5. Fill in the PR description template, including the checklist above.
6. The Security Team will review and either approve or request changes within 7 days.

We appreciate every contribution — thank you for making the Stellar ecosystem stronger!
